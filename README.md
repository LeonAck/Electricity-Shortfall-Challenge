# ⚡ Electricity Load Shortfall Forecasting

**Electricity-Shortfall-Challenge** is a machine learning system that forecasts the **3-hour electricity load shortfall in Spain**—the gap between renewable energy generation and fossil fuel-based supply—using city-level weather data from **2015–2017**. This project supports energy infrastructure planning by modeling renewable supply variability under changing weather conditions.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Forecast electricity load shortfall using weather data.
- **Scope**: 5 Spanish cities, 2015–2017.
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Data validation → model selection → training → cloud deployment → API inference.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Anonymized historical weather and energy data.
- **Features**: City-level weather variables (wind speed, humidity, etc.).
- **Target**: 3-hour electricity load shortfall.

---

## 🎯 Modeling Goal
- Predict the shortfall with high accuracy to optimize energy infrastructure planning.
- Compare models using **cross-validated RMSE** and hyperparameter tuning.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Orchestration**: Prefect for workflow automation.
- **Modeling**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, MLflow for tracking.
- **Deployment**: Flask API on Google Cloud Run.
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage for models and metadata.
- **CI/CD**: Google Cloud Build for automated testing and deployment.

### Clone and Set Up
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeonAck/Electricity-Shortfall-Challenge.git
cd Electricity-Shortfall-Challenge
```

### Install  `uv` and dependencies
```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
```
This installs all required packages including: scikit-learn, xgboost, mlflow, hydra-core, prefect, flask, google-cloud-storage.

### Set Up MLflow (Optional Local Tracking)
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri mlruns/
```

## 🚀 Training Pipeline

The main training logic is in `src/electricity_forecast/train.py`. It:
- Loads training data
- Applies preprocessing (scaling, imputation)
- Evaluates multiple models via cross-validation
- Performs hyperparameter tuning (if enabled)
- Compares with current production model in MLflow
- Retrains and registers the best model

```python
from src.electricity_forecast.train import choose_best_model
best_result = choose_best_model(train_df, config)
```

## 🔄 Prefect Workflow

The `prefect_forecast_energy_flow.py` file defines a scheduled workflow that:

- Validates data quality
- Trains candidate models
- Selects the best model (vs current production)
- Uploads improved models to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Validates upload integrity
- Sends logging notifications

Run Locally
```PowerShell
uv run python -m workflows.flows.prefect_forecast_energy_flow
```

## 📈 Model Evaluation & Selection

- **Cross-validation**: TimeSeriesSplit or custom time-aware splits
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: GridSearchCV via config
- **Model factory**: `get_model()` supports 15+ regressors
- **Final decision**: New model only replaces production model if it improves CV-RMSE

## 🧪 MLflow Integration

- Logs all model experiments (RMSE, params, metrics)
- Registers best model in MLflow Model Registry
- Promotes winning version to production alias
- Enables comparison with existing best model

## 🌐 API Deployment with Flask

The model is served via a lightweight Flask API deployed on Google Cloud Run.

### Endpoints
- `POST /predict`: Make predictions
- `GET /health`: Health check (used by Cloud Run)

### Request Format
```json
{
  "features": {
    "time": "2017-01-01 00:00:00",
    "Madrid_wind_speed": 12.5,
    "Barcelona_humidity": 80,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Response
```json
{ "prediction": [234.5] }
```

## 🛠️ CI/CD with Google Cloud Build

Automated testing via `test_code.yml` and cloud build via `gcp-build-key.yml`.

### Workflow:
- Run pytest on push
- Validate data and model training
- (Optional) Deploy API or trigger Prefect flow

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Finish testing for pipeline and training
- Add model monitoring (Evidently, WhyLogs) for drift & performance
- Set up alerting on model degradation
